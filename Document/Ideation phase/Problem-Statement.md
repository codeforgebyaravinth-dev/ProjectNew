# Problem Statement

## Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations

### Team Information
- **Team ID:** NM2025TMID08900
- **Organization:** ABC Corporation

---

## Executive Summary

ABC Corporation's support department currently relies on manual processes for assigning incoming support tickets to appropriate teams. This approach has resulted in operational inefficiencies, increased resolution times, and declining customer satisfaction scores.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Process
1. Support tickets arrive through multiple channels (email, portal, phone)
2. L1 support manually reviews each ticket
3. Manual categorization and priority assignment
4. Manual routing to appropriate support team
5. Team receives and begins work

### Time Breakdown
- **Ticket Receipt to Assignment:** 15-45 minutes
- **Manual Review Time:** 5-10 minutes per ticket
- **Misrouting Rate:** 18% of tickets
- **Re-routing Time:** Additional 30-60 minutes

---

## Key Problems Identified

### 1. Manual Assignment Delays
**Impact:** High  
**Description:** Average 30-minute delay before tickets reach appropriate teams

**Consequences:**
- Customer frustration during wait times
- SLA violations
- Reduced team productivity

---

### 2. Inconsistent Routing Decisions
**Impact:** High  
**Description:** Different L1 agents route similar tickets to different teams

**Consequences:**
- Knowledge silos
- Inefficient resource use
- Quality inconsistency

---

### 3. Unbalanced Workload Distribution
**Impact:** Medium  
**Description:** Some teams overwhelmed while others underutilized

**Consequences:**
- Burnout in busy teams
- Idle time in other teams
- Inefficient resource allocation

---

### 4. Lack of Learning from History
**Impact:** Medium  
**Description:** No system to learn from past successful resolutions

**Consequences:**
- Repeated routing mistakes
- No continuous improvement
- Lost optimization opportunities

---

### 5. Limited Scalability
**Impact:** High  
**Description:** Manual process cannot scale with growing ticket volume

**Consequences:**
- Increasing backlog
- Degrading service quality
- Need for continuous hiring
